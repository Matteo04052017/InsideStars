# InsideStars

This project is intended for astrophysicists that want to explain what is happening inside a Star. With the help of the kinect sensor, the user of the application can draw nuclear elements (like hydrogen) and make the react so that the nuclear rections of a star can be described to the audience. 

This project has been presented in Genova. A demonstration can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvEsc-n5Dkc)

## Requirements
This project was made with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) version `2018.2.9f1` using [Kinect v2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561).

## Project structure

There are 4 unity scenes: `Intro`, `Simulation`, `HBurning`, `HeBurning`:
* The `Intro` scene is the introduction of the application that is a view of the solar system with a camera that explore it until inside the star. 
* The `Simulation` is a simulated internal star environment with semi random simulated nuclear reaction.
* The `HBurning` scene is the gamification with the help of the kinect sensor of the hydrogen burning process;
* The `HeBurning` is the gamification with the help of the kinect sensor of the helium burning process
